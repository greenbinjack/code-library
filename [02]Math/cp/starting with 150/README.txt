DEAR HALAR PO HALA

AFTER LOOKING AT EACH SOLUTIONS, TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTION AT FIRST AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM, AND THEN CODE IT YOURSELF WITH YOUR OWN WORDS, OR YOUKNOWWHO WILL BREAK YOU APART IF CALLED FOR COPYING. ALSO DON'T FORGET TO PAY UP YOU-NOT-SO-GOOD-LOOKING-RICH-SPOILED-BRAT.

ALL THE SOLUTIONS ARE PREPARED BY - HARAMJADA
